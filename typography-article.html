            Typography plays a major role in how effectively information is presented on a website.
            It influences readability, hierarchy, tone, and how easily users can scan or navigate 
            a page. In this article, I compare the typography choices used by Apple and Spotify 
            to understand how their design decisions affect the overall user experience.

    <!-- Website 1 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Website 1: Apple</h2>
        <p>
            Website:  
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com</a>
        </p>

        <img src="Images/Website Screenshots/Apple Typography Screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple Website Typography">

        <p>
            The screenshot from Apple's MacBook Air page highlights their clean and highly refined
            approach to typography. The headline text uses a bold and modern variation of the
            San Francisco typeface, which Apple designed specifically for clarity on digital
            displays. Beneath the headline, the paragraphs are set in a lighter weight, creating
            a clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary information.
        </p>

        <p>
            The spacing between lines and paragraphs is generous, contributing to excellent readability.
            Apple's consistent left alignment and minimalistic layout help guide the eye naturally down
            the page. Even when the text blocks become longer, the strong structure and careful spacing
            keep the page easy to scan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, Apple's typography conveys professionalism, precision, and simplicity. Their
            choices reflect the brand's emphasis on high-quality design and a calm, premium user 
            experience.

    <!-- Website 2 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Website 2: Spotify</h2>
        <p>
            Website:  
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLp5XoPON0wI" target="_blank">https://www.spotify.com</a>
        </p>

        <img src="Images/Website Screenshots/Spotify Typography Screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Spotify Website Typography">

        <p>
            The screenshot from Spotify’s “Top Songs USA” page displays a bold and energetic use
            of typography. The page features a large, high-contrast headline that immediately draws
            attention. Spotify often uses heavy sans-serif typefaces for section titles, and this
            screenshot clearly showcases that approach.
        </p>

        <p>
            The text beneath the header—such as playlist names, descriptions, and menu labels—uses
            a cleaner, thinner sans-serif style that contrasts with the bold title. The combination
            of weights creates a helpful hierarchy, making it easy to distinguish primary information
            from supporting text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because Spotify frequently uses dark background colors, the white and light-colored text
            stands out sharply, improving readability and making each section visually dynamic.  
            This creates a sense of energy and modernity that fits the personality of the brand.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Comparison -->
    <section>
        <h2>Comparison</h2>

        <p>
            The typography on both websites is modern and sans-serif, but they use it to achieve
            very different goals. Apple’s text is structured, quiet, and highly refined. The spacing,
            alignment, and consistent rhythm create a smooth reading experience that feels 
            professional and minimalist.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, Spotify uses typography more expressively. The large headline on the 
            “Top Songs USA” page immediately captures attention, while the supporting text uses 
            contrasting weights and styles to keep the layout lively and energetic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apple’s typography communicates precision and calm simplicity, while Spotify’s conveys 
            movement, personality, and boldness. Each site’s approach fits its brand identity and 
            enhances the user experience in different ways.
