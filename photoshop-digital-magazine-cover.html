            <p>
                For my third Adobe Photoshop project, I designed a digital magazine cover for a fictional technology publication, ARC: Advanced Research & Concepts Technology.<br>
                The goal was to create a sleek, high-tech aesthetic with bold colors, striking imagery, and a futuristic feel.<br>
                All elements were organized into smart objects and clear folders for a non-destructive, editable workflow.<br>
                Key design features included a neon-inspired color palette, a glowing triangle effect around the model, and careful adjustments to background and subject lighting.<br>
                This project strengthened my skills in advanced Photoshop techniques, color theory, lighting, and composition while delivering a professional, cohesive, visually compelling cover.
