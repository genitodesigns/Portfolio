            <p>
                For my second Adobe Photoshop project, I created a series of social media ads promoting a welding certification program for a local polytechnic school.<br>
                The campaign included ads for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, designed to be cohesive while allowing each platform to stand out individually.<br>
                I used multiple artboards and Smart Objects to keep the file organized, editable, and consistent across the series.<br>
                Facebook featured a clean, flat design with a clipping mask and QR code for functionality.<br>
                Instagram introduced a 3D effect with layered gradients to highlight the subject.<br>
                LinkedIn combined elements from both designs with a professional layout, desaturated image, subtle gradient overlay, and enhanced text legibility.<br>
                This project strengthened my skills in multi-platform design, organized workflow, and Photoshop techniques while creating visually distinct, professional ads.
