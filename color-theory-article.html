            In this article, I compare the use of color on two different websites.  
            Color is an essential part of visual communication, affecting readability, mood,  
            accessibility, and overall user experience. By examining how each site uses  
            its color palettes, we can better understand why certain choices succeed  
            while others fall short.

    <!-- Website 1 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Website 1: Apple</h2>
        <p>
            Website:  
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Apple's website is well known for its minimalist color palette, typically using  
            black, white, and subtle grays. This monochromatic approach creates a high level  
            of contrast that draws attention to the product images, which often contain the  
            most vibrant colors on the page. The white background provides a clean and modern  
            aesthetic while ensuring that text remains fully readable.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Because Apple relies heavily on product photography, their restrained use of color  
            allows each featured device to stand out. This creates a sense of luxury, simplicity,  
            and professionalism. The consistent color approach reinforces Apple’s brand identity  
            across the entire site.

    <!-- Website 2 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Website 2: Spotify</h2>
        <p>
            Website:  
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">https://www.spotify.com</a>
        </p>

        <img src="Images/Website Screenshots/Spotify Screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Spotify Website">

        <p>
            In contrast to Apple's minimal palette, Spotify uses bold and vibrant colors  
            throughout its website. The brand is known for high-saturation greens, purples,  
            blues, and pinks that create an energetic and modern feel. These colors appeal to  
            a younger audience and reinforce the idea of music being expressive and dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spotify's color choices also help guide users' attention. Bright accent colors are  
            used for buttons, calls to action, and promotional banners, making them immediately  
            noticeable. The darker background tones create strong contrast, making the neon-like  
            accents even more striking.

    <!-- Comparison -->
    <section>
        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            The two websites use color very differently to support their goals. Apple relies on  
            a minimalist and refined palette that emphasizes clarity and product focus, while  
            Spotify uses high-energy colors to communicate creativity and excitement. Both
            approaches are effective for their respective audiences. Apple’s palette appeals  
            to a broad, professional consumer base, while Spotify’s palette resonates with users  
            who enjoy vibrant and modern digital experiences. This comparison highlights how color
            is not simply decorative—it is a powerful design tool that influences how users feel,
            interact, and make decisions on a website.
