                For my first Adobe Photoshop project, I restored an old, damaged photograph from Wikimedia.<br>
                The goal was to preserve the image’s original charm while repairing imperfections and maintaining an authentic look.<br>
                I worked non-destructively using Smart Objects and a clear layer structure to keep the process organized and editable.<br>
                Color correction, clone stamp cleanup, and reconstruction were applied in stages to ensure a seamless, natural result.<br>
                Finally, Neural Filters were used for subtle enhancements, improving contrast and removing artifacts without over-editing.<br>
                The final image reflects both technical skill and respect for the original photograph, resulting in a clean, professional restoration.
